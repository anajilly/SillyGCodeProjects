SillyGCodeProjects
==================

A space where one can backup projects having to do with the Koike or any kind of GCode (of SVG) oriented machine.

I just finished making a little perl script that generates either svg or gcode depending on what I want to do with it. (look at a picture? or feed it into the koike.)  This program produces one specific object, a cross-section of a parabolic trough mirror, for the foam cutter.  I'm making a repository so that I can get this off of my little computer as a backup, and I may as well share these little scripts too.  I chose an MIT license for God knows what reason. It doesn't matter at all.
